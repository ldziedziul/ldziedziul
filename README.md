# Hi there 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** who builds things, breaks them, fixes them, and shares what I learn.  
I focus on backend systems, cloud infrastructure, pragmatic DevOps - and I run a homelab where I experiment with all of it.

### 🧪 Homelab

I run a fairly extensive **homelab** used as a real-world playground for infrastructure, automation, and self-hosting.

It includes:
- **Virtualization & containers**: Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes (GitOps with Argo CD)
- **Networking & security**: OpenWRT, WireGuard, NetBird, Pi-hole, reverse proxies
- **CI/CD & platforms**: self-hosted CI, container deployment platforms
- **Monitoring & observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, uptime checks, log aggregation
- **Smart home & video**: Home Assistant, NVR, camera streaming, AI-based video analysis
- **Storage & backups**: NAS, automated backups, document management
- **Automation & integrations**: workflow automation, API integrations, internal dashboards

Most ideas are tested here first - broken safely, fixed properly, and only then reused in production or shared publicly.
